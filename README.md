# about

cuspid is a visualization tool that displays images and videos in various modes of manipulation.  It is inspired by microscopy and the aesthetics of found/accidental texture.

It is aimed at being used as backing material for non/musical performance, and other uses may be discovered.

The concept is that it might be used something like this:

# running it

cuspid is mostly intended to be hosted, but if you want to run it for development or exploration:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:breedx2/cuspid.git
$ cd cuspid
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then point a browser to http://localhost:8080/workspace

# keys

Nearly all aspects of cuspid can be controlled via the keyboard.  This includes
mode changes, speeds, and effects toggles.

[See here for a complete list of all keystrokes](../master/docs/KEYS.md).

# OSC

In addition to the above keystrokes, cuspid has out-of-the-box support for Open Sound Control.
This allows web client viewports to be controlled by remote OSC messages, which could
be generated by 3rd party software or MIDI mapping software.

[See here for docs on cuspid OSC message format/structure](../master/docs/OSC.md).

# Pd

Pd or PureData is a graphical language for doing sound/media work.  There's a very small amount of support for sending OSC from Pd.  See [the pd/ dir](../master/pd) for details.
