# OSC

[OSC (Open Sound Control)](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) is lightweight protocol for sending control messages between pieces of musical instrumentation.

Cuspid has out-of-the-box support for Open Sound Control.
This allows web client viewports to be controlled by remote OSC messages, which could
be generated by 3rd party software or MIDI mapping software.

When a web client connects to the cuspid server, it registers with an id.  This id can be used by the OSC sender to uniquely address a single or group of web clients.

```
              osc/udp                  ws
  controller ---------> cuspid server -------> cuspid webclient
```

## messages

See [ws-events.js](../master/src/ws-events.js) for gory details.

In these examples `{id}` is the client id being addressed.

| address                   | arg(s)       | notes        |
| ------------------------- |--------------| -------------|
| /{id}/mode                | {modename}   | modename can be `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `paletteUp`, `paletteDown`, `blend`, `imageSequence`, `stillImage`, `zoomSequenceIn`, `zoomSequenceOut`
| /{id}/togglePause         |              | toggles play/stop
| /{id}/pause               | 0, 1         | 0 = pause, 1 = play             
| /{id}/nextImage           |              | shows next image, only valid in certain modes
| /{id}/imageSet            | {n}          | use image set {n} (currently 1,2)
| /{id}/toggleInterpolation |              | toggles smooth pixel interpolation
| /{id}/toggleFps           |              | toggles on-screen framerate display
| /{id}/toggleDotPass       |              | toggles dot-screen effect.  
| /{id}/dotPass             | 0, 1         | 0 = disable effect, 1 = enable effect
| /{id}/dotScale            | {scale}      | sets the dot scale factor to a specific value
| /{id}/deltaDotScale       | {delta}      | adjusts the dot scale factor by a certain amount
| /{id}/toggleGlitchPass    |              | toggles the glitch pass effect
| /{id}/glitchPass          | 0, 1         | 0 = disable glitch effect, 1 = enable glitch effect
| /{id}/toggleInvert        |              | toggles the invert pass efect
| /{id}/invert              | 0, 1         | 0 = disable invert, 1 = enable invert
| /{id}/speedUp             | {num}        | speed up by {num} amount
| /{id}/slowDown            | {num}        | slow down by  {num} amount
| /{id}/speed               | {speed}      | set speed value to specific value
| /{id}/zoom                | {zoom}       | set zoom to specific value range, min = 1
| /{id}/nudgeLeft           | {num}        | when zoomed, nudge image left by {num} amount.  only valid in some display modes.
| /{id}/nudgeRight          | {num}        | when zoomed, nudge image right by {num} amount.  only valid in some display modes.
| /{id}/nudgeUp             | {num}        | when zoomed, nudge image up by {num} amount.  only valid in some display modes.
| /{id}/nudgeDown           | {num}        | when zoomed, nudge image down by {num} amount.  only valid in some display modes.
| /{id}/bias                | {num}        | when in blend mode, set the bias level to {num}
| /{id}/biasDelta           | {delta}      | when in blend mode, adjust the bias level by {delta}
| /{id}/advanceOneFrame     |              | advances one fake "frame". makes the most sense when paused.
